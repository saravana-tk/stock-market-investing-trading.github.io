## Global View
Let's start with ***Europe*** which is going through a slowdown. ***Germany, France and United Kingdom*** are experiencing tough challenges with high energy cost amidst the transition towards renewable energy. Chinese economy has not bounced back since the covid lockdown and still the country is in deflationary(less money chasing more goods) mode. It is important to note that the exports from ***China*** is growing and in *2024* the trade surplus stands at **1 trillion USD**. The **US Dollar** has strengthened considerably causing the emerging market currencies to weaken.

Amidst all this ***India*** is seeking to steady and sustain the growth post Covid. ***India's*** exports have always been influence by Global trade trends and hence there is a higher volatility expected in the exports from ***India*** amidst an evolving global trade climate. India should seek to expand the domestic consumption to offset the export volatility which is expected to continue in the near term. ***India's*** competition is not only with other emerging countries but also with other advanced economies who are trying to keep their businesses at home. India has an uphill task of gaining business against intense competition which requires not only keeping costs low but innovating rapidly across many spheres. 

## Focus Areas 
1. Global carbon emissions mandates and India's heavy dependence on fossil fuel requires India to move towards renewable energy generation to meet the ever growing domestic energy demand.
2. India faces rapid urbanization and hence the public transportation infrastructure needs to be expanded on a war footing. 
3. The ease of doing business should improve and deregulation should happen to make the businesses flourish.
4. Health of the citizens of India should be given paramount importance if one has to reap the demographic dividend that the country has it's disposal. The rise in the consumption of Ultra processed fast foods is a cause of concern. These fast foods are high in Fat, Salt and Sugar. This industry growing at **33% CAGR from 2006 (900 Million USD to 37.9 Billion USD)** is a huge concern.

## State of the economy
1. ***India*** is expected to grow at 6.4% in FY25. There is weak global demand for manufacturing. Agriculture sector is strong. Private consumption is steady contributing to strong domestic demand. There is surplus in the services trade and inward remittances are healthy.
2. Near term growth is stable. India needs grass root level structural reforms and deregulation to accelerate the medium term growth.
